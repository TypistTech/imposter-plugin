## Why?

Because of the lack of dependency management in WordPress, if two plugins bundled conflicting versions of the same package, hard-to-reproduce bugs arise.
Monkey patching composer vendor packages, wrapping them inside your own namespace is a less-than-ideal solution to avoid such conflicts. 

See:
[A Narrative of Using Composer in a WordPress Plugin](https://wptavern.com/a-narrative-of-using-composer-in-a-wordpress-plugin)
[A Warning About Using Composer With WordPress](https://blog.wppusher.com/a-warning-about-using-composer-with-wordpress/)

## Install

Installation should be done via composer, details of how to install composer can be found at [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/).

``` bash
$ composer require typisttech/imposter-plugin
```

Then, config the imposter-plugin namespace in your `composer.json`

```json
"extra": {
    "imposter-plugin": {
        "namespace": "My\\App\\Vendor"
    }
}
```

## Usage

After every `$ composer install` and `$ composer update`: 

```php
<?php 

use TypistTech\Imposter Plugin\Imposter PluginFactory;

$imposter-plugin = Imposter PluginFactory::forProject('/path/to/project/root');
$imposter-plugin->run();
```

The above snippet:
1. Look for `/path/to/project/root/composer.json`
2. Find out [vendor-dir](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#vendor-dir)
3. Find out all [required packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require), including those required by dependencies
4. Find out all [autoload paths](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) for all required packages
5. Prefix all namespaces with the imposter-plugin namespace defined in your `composer.json`

Before:
```php
<?php

namespace Dummy\File;

use AnotherDummy\{
    SubAnotherDummy, SubOtherDummy
};
use Dummy\SubOtherDummy;
use OtherDummy\SubOtherDummy;

class DummyClass
{
}
```

After:
```php
<?php

namespace My\App\Vendor\Dummy\File;

use My\App\Vendor\AnotherDummy\{
    SubAnotherDummy, SubOtherDummy
};
use My\App\Vendor\Dummy\SubOtherDummy;
use My\App\Vendor\OtherDummy\SubOtherDummy;

class DummyClass
{
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Imposter Plugin support `PSR4`, `PSR0`, `Classmap` and `Files`?

Yes for all. PSR-4 and PSR-0 autoloading, classmap generation and files includes are supported.

### Does Imposter Plugin support `exclude-from-classmap`?

Not for now. 
Pull requests are welcome.

### How about `require-dev` packages?

Imposter Plugin do nothing on `require-dev` packages because imposter-plugin is intended for avoiding production environment., not for development environment. 


### How about packages that don't use namespaces?

Not for now. 
Tell me your idea by [opening an issue](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter-plugin/issues/new)

### How about packages that use fully qualified name?

Not for now. We need a better regex in the [Transformer](src/Transformer.php) class.
